## Goal of this class {.increment}

**This class will teach you to use R to**: 

- Generate graphical and tabular data summaries

- Efficiently manipulate data using **tidyverse** libraries

- Perform statistical analyses (e.g., hypothesis testing, regression modeling)

- Produce _reproducible_ statistical reports using R Markdown

> - Near the end of class we'll also preview how to integrate R with other tools (e.g., databases, web, etc.)


## Why R?

- Free (open-source)

- Programming language (not point-and-click)

- Excellent graphics

- Offers broadest range of statistical tools

- Easy to generate reproducible reports

- Easy to integrate with other tools



## The R Console

Basic interaction with R is through typing in the **console**

This is the **terminal** or **command-line** interface

```{r, out.height = "400px", echo = FALSE}
# knitr::include_graphics("./figures/rterminal.png")
```



## The R Console
- You type in commands, R gives back answers (or errors)

- Menus and other graphical interfaces are extras built on top of the console

- We will use **RStudio** in this class

1. Download R: http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/R/CRAN

2. Then download RStudio: http://www.rstudio.com/


## RStudio is an IDE for R

RStudio has 4 main windows ('panes'):

- Source
- Console 
- Workspace/History
- Files/Plots/Packages/Help

## RStudio is an IDE for R

<div style="float: left; width: 30%;">
RStudio has 4 main windows (aka 'panes'):

- Source
- Console 
- Workspace/History
- Files/Plots/Packages/Help
</div>

<div style="float: right; width: 65%;">
```{r, out.height = "500px", echo = FALSE}
# knitr::include_graphics("./figures/rstudio_panes.png")
```
</div>

## RStudio: Panes overview

1. __Source__ pane: create a file that you can save and run later

2. __Console__ pane: type or paste in commands to get output from R

3. __Workspace/History__ pane: see a list of variables or previous commands

4.  __Files/Plots/Packages/Help__ pane: see plots, help pages, and other items in this window.

## Console pane

<div style="float: left; width: 40%;">
- Use the **Console** pane to type or paste commands to get output from R

- To look up the help file for a function or data set, type `?function` into the Console
  - E.g.,  try typing in `?mean`
  
- Use the `tab` key to auto-complete function and object names
</div>

<div style="float: right; width: 55%;">
```{r, out.height = "400px", echo = FALSE}
# knitr::include_graphics("./figures/pane_console.png")
```
</div>


## Source pane

<div style="float: left; width: 40%;">
- Use the **Source** pane to create and edit R and Rmd files

- The menu bar of this pane contains handy shortcuts for sending code to the **Console** for evaluation
</div>

<div style="float: right; width: 55%;">
```{r, out.height = "400px", echo = FALSE}
# knitr::include_graphics("./figures/pane_source.png")
```
</div>



## Files/Plots/Packages/Help pane

<div style="float: left; width: 40%;">
- By default, any figures you produce in R will be displayed in the **Plots** tab 
  - Menu bar allows you to Zoom, Export, and Navigate back to older plots
  
- When you request a help file (e.g., `?mean`), the documentation will appear in the **Help** tab
</div>

<div style="float: right; width: 55%;">
```{r, out.height = "400px", echo = FALSE}
# knitr::include_graphics("./figures/pane_plots.png")
```
</div>


## RStudio: Source and Console panes

```{r, out.height = "500px", echo = FALSE}
# knitr::include_graphics("./figures/rstudio.png")
```


## RStudio: Console

```{r, out.height = "500px", echo = FALSE}
# knitr::include_graphics("./figures/variables.png")
```


## RStudio: Toolbar

```{r, out.height = "500px", echo = FALSE}
# knitr::include_graphics("./figures/menus.png")
```


## R Markdown
- R Markdown allows the user to integrate R code into a report

- When data changes or code changes, so does the report

- No more need to copy-and-paste graphics, tables, or numbers

- Creates __reproducible__ reports
  - Anyone who has your R Markdown (.Rmd) file and input data can re-run your analysis and get the exact same results (tables, figures, summaries)
  
- Can output report in HTML (default), Microsoft Word, or PDF

## R Markdown

<div style="float: left; width: 30%;">
- This example shows an **R Markdown** (.Rmd) file opened in the Source pane of RStudio.  
- To turn an Rmd file into a report, click the **Knit HTML** button in the Source pane menu bar
- The results will appear in a **Preview window**, as shown on the right
- You can knit into html (default), MS Word, and pdf format
- These lecture slides are also created in RStudio (using ioslides as the output format)
</div>

<div style="float: right; width: 65%;">
```{r, out.height = "400px", echo = FALSE}
# knitr::include_graphics("./figures/rmarkdown1.png")
```
</div>


## R Markdown

<div style="float: left; width: 30%;">
- To integrate R output into your report, you need to use R code chunks

- All of the code that appears in between the "triple back-ticks" gets executed when you Knit
</div>

<div style="float: right; width: 65%;">
```{r, out.height = "500px", echo = FALSE}
# knitr::include_graphics("./figures/rmarkdown2.png")
```
</div>


## In-class exercise: Hello world!

1. Open **RStudio** on your machine

2. File > New File > R Markdown ...
3. Change `summary(cars)` in the first code block to `print("Hello world!")`
4. Click `Knit HTML` to produce an HTML file.
5. Save your Rmd file as `helloworld.Rmd`


> All of your Homework assignments and many of your Labs will  take the form of a single Rmd file, which you will edit to include your solutions and then submit on Canvas

## Basics: the class in a nutshell
- Everything we'll do comes down to applying **functions** to **data**

- **Data**:  things like 7, "seven", $7.000$, the matrix $\left[ \begin{array}{ccc} 7 & 7 & 7 \\ 7 & 7 & 7\end{array}\right]$

- **Functions**: things like $\log{}$, $+$ (two arguments), $<$ (two), $\mod{}$ (two), `mean` (one)

> A function is a machine which turns input objects (**arguments**) into an output object (**return value**), possibly with **side effects**, according to a definite rule

## Data building blocks

You'll encounter different kinds of data types

- **Booleans** Direct binary values: `TRUE` or `FALSE` in R

- **Integers**: whole numbers (positive, negative or zero)

- **Characters** fixed-length blocks of bits, with special coding;
**strings** = sequences of characters

- **Floating point numbers**: a fraction (with a finite number of bits) times an exponent, like $1.87 \times {10}^{6}$

- **Missing or ill-defined values**: `NA`, `NaN`, etc.


## Operators (functions)
You can use R as a very, very fancy calculator

Command | Description
--------|-------------
`+,-,*,\` | add, subtract, multiply, divide
`^` | raise to the power of
`%%` | remainder after division (ex: `8 %% 3 = 2`)
`( )` | change the order of operations
`log(), exp()` | logarithms and exponents (ex: `log(10) = 2.302`)
`sqrt()` | square root
`round()` | round to the nearest whole number (ex: `round(2.3) = 2`)
`floor(), ceiling()` | round down or round up 
`abs()` | absolute value
## 

```{r}
7 + 5 # Addition
7 - 5 # Subtraction
7 * 5 # Multiplication
7 ^ 5 # Exponentiation
```
## 
```{r}
7 / 5 # Division
7 %% 5 # Modulus
7 %/% 5 # Integer division 
```

## Operators cont'd.
  **Comparisons** are also binary operators; they take two objects, like numbers, and give a Boolean
```{r}
7 > 5
7 < 5
7 >= 7
7 <= 5
```
## 
```{r}
7 == 5
7 != 5
```

## Boolean operators
  Basically "and" and "or":
  
```{r}
(5 > 7) & (6*7 == 42)
(5 > 7) | (6*7 == 42)
```

<small>(will see special doubled forms, `&&` and `||`, later)</small>
  
  
##   More types
  
- `typeof()` function returns the type

- `is.`_foo_`()` functions return Booleans for whether the argument is of type _foo_

- `as.`_foo_`()` (tries to) "cast" its argument to type _foo_ --- to translate it sensibly into a _foo_-type value

<small>**Special case**: `as.factor()` will be important later for telling R when numbers are actually encodings and not numeric values.  (E.g., 1 = High school grad; 2 = College grad; 3 = Postgrad) </small>
## 
  ```{r}
typeof(7)
is.numeric(7)
is.na(7)
```
##   
  ```{r}
is.character(7)
is.character("7")
is.character("seven")
is.na("seven")
```
  
## Variables
  
  We can give names to data objects; these give us **variables**
  
  A few variables are built in:
```{r}
pi
```

Variables can be arguments to functions or operators, just like constants:
```{r}
pi*10
cos(pi)
```

## Assignment operator
Most variables are created with the **assignment operator**, `<-` or `=`  

```{r}
time.factor <- 12
time.factor
time.in.years = 2.5
time.in.years * time.factor
```
## 
The assignment operator also changes values:
```{r}
time.in.months <- time.in.years * time.factor
time.in.months
time.in.months <- 45
time.in.months
```
## 
  
- Using names and variables makes code: easier to design, easier to debug, less prone to bugs, easier to improve,  and easier for others to read

- Avoid "magic constants"; use named variables

- Use descriptive variable names
  - Good: `num.students <- 35`
  - Bad: `ns <- 35 `

  
  
##   The workspace
  What names have you defined values for?
```{r}
ls()
```

Getting rid of variables:
```{r}
rm("time.in.months")
ls()
```

## First data structure: vectors
  
- Group related data values into one object, a **data structure**
  
- A **vector** is a sequence of values, all of the same type

- `c()` function returns a vector containing all its arguments in order
```{r}
students <- c("Sean", "Louisa", "Frank", "Farhad", "Li")
midterm <- c(80, 90, 93, 82, 95)
```

- Typing the variable name at the prompt causes it to display

```{r}
students
```

## Indexing
- `vec[1]` is the first element, `vec[4]` is the 4th element of `vec`
```{r}
students
students[4]
```
- `vec[-4]` is a vector containing all but the fourth element
```{r}
students[-4]
```


## Vector arithmetic
  
Operators apply to vectors "pairwise" or "elementwise":
```{r}
final <- c(78, 84, 95, 82, 91) # Final exam scores
midterm # Midterm exam scores
midterm + final # Sum of midterm and final scores
(midterm + final)/2 # Average exam score
course.grades <- 0.4*midterm + 0.6*final # Final course grade
course.grades
```

## Pairwise comparisons
Is the final score higher than the midterm score?
```{r}
midterm 
final
final > midterm
```

Boolean operators can be applied elementwise:
```{r}
(final < midterm) & (midterm > 80)
```

## Functions on vectors
Command | Description
--------|------------
`sum(vec)` | sums up all the elements of `vec`
`mean(vec)` | mean of `vec`
`median(vec)` | median of `vec`
`min(vec), max(vec)` | the largest or smallest element of `vec`
`sd(vec), var(vec)` | the standard deviation and variance of `vec`
`length(vec)` | the number of elements in `vec`
`pmax(vec1, vec2), pmin(vec1, vec2)` | example: `pmax(quiz1, quiz2)` returns the higher of quiz 1 and quiz 2 for each student
`sort(vec)` | returns the `vec` in sorted order
`order(vec)` | returns the index that sorts the vector `vec`
`unique(vec)` | lists the unique elements of `vec`
`summary(vec)` | gives a five-number summary  
`any(vec), all(vec)` | useful on Boolean vectors

## Functions on vectors
```{r}
course.grades
mean(course.grades) # mean grade
median(course.grades)
sd(course.grades) # grade standard deviation
```

## More functions on vectors
```{r}
sort(course.grades)
max(course.grades) # highest course grade
min(course.grades) # lowest course grade
```
## Referencing elements of vectors
```{r}  
students
```
  
  Vector of indices:
```{r}
students[c(2,4)]
```

Vector of negative indices
```{r}
students[c(-1,-3)]
```

## More referencing

`which()` returns the `TRUE` indexes of a Boolean vector:
```{r}
course.grades
a.threshold <- 90 # A grade = 90% or higher
course.grades >= a.threshold # vector of booleans
a.students <- which(course.grades >= a.threshold) # Applying which() 
a.students
students[a.students] # Names of A students
```

## Named components
  
You can give names to elements or components of vectors
```{r}
students
names(course.grades) <- students # Assign names to the grades
names(course.grades)
course.grades[c("Sean", "Frank","Li")] # Get final grades for 3 students
```
Note the labels in what R prints; these are not actually part of the value

## Useful RStudio tips
Keystroke | Description
----------|-------------
`<tab>` | autocompletes commands and filenames, and lists arguments for functions. Highly useful!
`<up>` | cycle through previous commands in the console prompt
`<ctrl-up>` | lists history of previous commands matching an unfinished one
`<ctrl-enter>` | paste current line from source window to console. Good for trying things out ideas from a source file.
`<ESC>` | as mentioned, abort an unfinished command and get out of the + prompt
